        Several years ago, on the distant planet-world of Frontier, ancient civilizations began to revive.
        People, led by artificial intelligence, quickly immersed themselves in a new world.
        Ancient eras were intertwined in a strange and surprising way with the modern technological way of life.
        This world was gradually divided into parts, dominated by one of the ancient cultures.

        Nobody believed in mysticism and evil spirits for a long time.
        The people of the future were completely unprepared to survive in such a world.
        The immunity that previously helped to resist evil spirits was long ago lost.

        Fortunately, after the monsters, the heroes of old times came into the world.
        There weren't many of them. But each of them possessed superhuman strength.

        The hunt for the Blood of Heroes - this most valuable resource - has begun on the part of the dominant factions in the future.
        The religious Black Conclave, which reveres immortality, sent its best officers to the Frontier, who despise biological life as weakness and a lower form.
        And then the Union of Industrialists, which monopolizes the production of heavy metals, sent out its faceless mercenaries, obsessed with the thirst for material gain.
        Which of them occupied the Frontier first?

        The Black Conclave's theo-engineers built defensive redoubts. And the half-dead aristocrats had already begun hunting for heroes at that moment,
        when numerous mercenaries of the Union of Industrialists landed on the surface of the planet.
        To break the Black defenses, the Industrialists took advantage of their numerical advantage.
        The planet was isolated, as required by modern rules of armed conflict.
        Now no one could leave the Frontier until one of the parties surrendered.
        Like the rest of the world, they didn't know what was going on on the Frontier.

        Countless groups of militants of the Union of Industrialists had already established logistics and began hunting for heroes at that moment,
        when an elite unit of the Black Conclave landed on the surface of the planet.
        To gain the tactical superiority of the Industrialists, the Blacks decided to use a secret weapon - the Champion of the Faith.
        The planet was isolated, as required by modern rules of armed conflict.
        Now no one could leave the Frontier until one of the parties surrendered.
