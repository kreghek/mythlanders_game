        Wooded area covered with thick snow. An ancient Slavic warrior, in power armor, is hiding from his pursuers. He stops to listen to the sounds of battle coming from the dark thicket ahead. Suddenly, he hears a rustling behind him and turns around, ready to fight.

        The wounded Digital Hort slowly emerges from the snow cover. His eyes emit a faint light, and his energy body is unstable and distorts more than normal.
        It does not look like other Horts, which were extremely aggressive life forms. This one seems to be more alive.

        "Help... us..." The synthetic electrical noise was difficult to form into human words.

        "Fire storms! And how can you speak, wolf? Why are you asking for help? Something is unclean in this..." Berimir gripped his weapon tighter for a quick blow.

        "Our enemies... they are creating new gods... I have been given my word to give you a choice, people of Myth. Either you rise above all this and stop the Shadow. Or you yourself will become the monsters that you call us..."

        "New gods? You're lying, beast!"

        "Man... My time is running out. Gather your Flock and step into the Shadow together. Now get ready for one of many fights... and try not to die too early!"

        Berimir listened carefully to the words of the wounded digital creature, hitherto hostile to him. It happened that wolves helped people of old times. "Grey, hold on. I will go into battle and help you, no matter who you are. But first you will survive. Got it?"

        "Help them... and us all..."

        The warrior cast an anxious glance into the thicket, listening to what was happening. Instant! And the hort quickly changes and, with the last of his strength, predatorily jumps on the warrior. The wounded monster is ready to fight until his last breath. Was this chatter really a trap?!
